Meglofriend's Dota 2 Counter Pick Server.

For use, visit: Meglobot.com/CounterPick

The applications enables you to enter a team composition and view which heroes match up the best against the chosen set. With this you are able to see the possible counters to based off Advantage percentage, a statistic developed by Dotabuff and average win rate.

The server uses a combination of jaunt for web scrapping and Jython to access the Dota 2 API through python. The application starts a thread for each connection and deciphers the payload of each connection and responds accordingly. At this point it has two major functions: Return the initial list of all heroes, which contains links to images, their name and primary attribute; Return a list of comparision data for each other hero against the given hero.

The application itself is an example of responsive interface design and of a dynamic single page application.
